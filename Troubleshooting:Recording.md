# Recording Troubleshooting

Here you can potentially log any issue you've seen on the recorded datasets and the related solution.

## Inaugural Recording

- problem 1
- problem 2

## Second Recording

- @Rheiney: The altitude channel of the GPS-emlid is NaN. If you compare it
  agains the `Inaugural Recording`.

- @Rheiney: The os1 lidar missed some part of the frames, @Nacho and @Rheiney
  took a look to this and discussed with Ouster people and apparently it's
  related to a network bloating issue. This was the last dataset using ethernet
  interface, newer datasets should use the thunderbolt connection.

- @Rheiney: Missing frames in the camera topic
