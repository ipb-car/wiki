Worry not! If you are setting up the ipb-car for the very first time, you only need:

1. An ipb-car
1. A logging laptop with a **thunderbolt** port, that looks exactly like a USB-C port but it is not
1. A raspberry-pi 4

You can check all the details on the [host-machine-setup](https://gitlab.ipb.uni-bonn.de/ipb-team/robots/ipb-car/docs/-/wikis/Setup%3AHost-machine-setup) and the [rpi-setup](https://gitlab.ipb.uni-bonn.de/ipb-team/robots/ipb-car/docs/-/wikis/Setup%3ARpi-setup) but it should be straight forward
