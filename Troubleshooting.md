**This page and subpages do not replace by any means the use of [Gitlab issue system](https://gitlab.ipb.uni-bonn.de/groups/ipb-team/robots/ipb-car/-/issues)**.

On this wiki page, you will find all the information needed to solve common and frequent problems
while working with the car mount setup.

You should update this documentation (ideally) whenever you encounter any
problems that don't have any solution and have been already reported in the [Gitlab issue system](https://gitlab.ipb.uni-bonn.de/groups/ipb-team/robots/ipb-car/-/issues), or if you struggle with anything related to the car mount setup. The
final goal is to avoid people making the same mistake again and again or going
through unnecessary pain that other people have already had.
